# Discord Modmail
Simple Discord Modmail bot, which you may know from big servers.

## How to use
Go into `settings.py` and change `"GUILD_ID"` to your server/guild Id.
Now that you are done, use the **.support** command, and the bot will message you, describe the problem, and the bot creates a new channel in which you can send messages 
directly to the user. Use **.close `UserId` `(Reason)`** to close the channel and the ticket, the bot will automatically send the user a message, that the ticket has been closed.
